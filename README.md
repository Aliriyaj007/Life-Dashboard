## 📖 Philosophy

Most productivity tools are over-engineered. They demand your attention, send notifications, and lock your data behind accounts.

This dashboard is different. It is built on **Systems Thinking**:
1.  **Local-First:** Your data lives in your browser's `localStorage`. It never leaves your device.
2.  **Zero Dependencies:** No frameworks, no build steps, no backend. Just one file.
3.  **Digital Notebook:** It feels like a tool you own, not a service you rent.

## 🔄 The Shift: Before vs. After

| Forgetting to track due to friction | **Instant load**, distraction-free interface |
| Data locked in proprietary cloud apps | **Open standard** JSON data you control |
| Monthly subscription fees | **Free forever**, self-hosted or local |
| Overwhelmed by daily noise | Focused on **weekly/monthly trends** |

## 🚀 Usage in 60 Seconds

### Method 1: The Browser (Easiest)
1.  Click the [Web App Link](https://aliriyaj007.github.io/Life-Dashboard/).
2.  Define your 3-5 metrics (e.g., *Health, Focus, Code, Spirit*).
3.  Bookmark the page.
    *   *Note: Data persists in your browser cache.*

### Method 2: The "Forever" File (Recommended)
1.  Download the `life-dashboard-pro.html` file.
2.  Save it to your computer or phone.
3.  Open it in any web browser.
4.  **It works offline.** You can put it on a USB drive, and it will still work in 10 years.

## 🛠 Deployment & Configuration

Because this is a single file, "deployment" is trivial.

**Self-Hosting (GitHub Pages)**
1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Go to `Settings` -> `Pages`.
3.  Select `main` branch and `/root` folder.
4.  Save. Your dashboard is now live at `username.github.io/repo`.

**Customizing Metrics**
You can rename metrics directly in the **Settings** tab of the dashboard. No code editing required.

**Resetting**
To wipe all data and start fresh, go to **Settings > Danger Zone > Factory Reset**.
